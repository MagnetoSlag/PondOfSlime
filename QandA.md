# Questions:

1. According to my understanding, 'ID' and 'OrderNumer' are refering to same number, am I right?

2. In your 2nd PNG file, You mentioned that "If you run a command ">orderclaim(ID)", you take the order and no one else can run that command on the same ID".
  - 2.a Does that mean any one can claim an order no need to be the Customer who place the order?
  - 2.b If 2.a is true, do you still want to record who place the order at the first place? i.e still record files 'Customer' into the database?
  
3. Are you sure you want a 3 digi random order number (ID) instead of sequential order number?

Thank you for your reply!
