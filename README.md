## A little pond where I share some interesting info with CEO
To make life easier, there are few things I would like to clarifly before we step into the world of computer.
Some of them you may already know, some may be new to you and some maybe not the same as you knew before.
Anyway, please seat back and read with some spare time.
Ofcause, if you dont want to read, just move onto your js is ok.
### READ READ READ READ the god damn book!
Please execuse me for my poor English proficiency, as you always know, my English SUCKS....

*Read the god damn book!* is what I always heard from my college teacher. He once said, reading non-friction is boring, especially something technical or something you simply have no interest in. But reading, is a must. This is the door way to open a whole new world. Later when you growth up, reading those insurance policy, college prospectus :books: will make you fainted in just 3 sec. however, you **MUST** read and read in detail because that will save your life a million times in the future and you wont regert reading it at the first time.

Enough BS, now get back on track. To help you better understanding or do whatever you would like to do with Discord, web, graphic etc, some computer terms you better have some fundermental understanding, or at least, know what people are talking about.

This world is a strange place, most people like to say some Mars language to make them feel good about themself, but not the computer world, actually the world of computer is very simple.

#### HardWare

- Computer Hardware

  - A computer is a piece of hardware, something you can touch actually, ***ALL*** computer makeup of *Input OutPut Device* and *CPU* no exception as of year 2018! (your phone is a computer too!)
  
    - **Input Output Device**, is simply a piece of hardware you interact with a computer, a keyboard is an input device, a monitor is an output decice, a headphone is an output device too!
   
    - **CPU**, Central Processing Unit, this is where your big computer case enclosed, inside a CPU, you will find the **Processing unit** and the **Storage Unit**
   
      - **Processing Unit**, (a semiconductor chip, or just simply a piece of metal which do all the calculation, it really, just around your little finger nail size) :stuck_out_tongue: 
      
      - **Storage**, Storage is where the CPU storage information, it is just like the plate to hold food when you do cooking and another plate after you do cooking. To hold information rather it is temporary or for a long period of time. Simply remember, CPU DONT remember anything! it just process data, like if you want the computer to do calculation 1 + 2, you will need a storage to store the value 1 and 2 as well as the result storage holding value 3, the CPU just do the adding job by taking 1 and 2 from storage add them and put back to storage for result.
      
        - Storage usually catagorized by the speed of response, i.e. how fast the CPU can read/write information to it. some will retain information after you remove the power while some will not. I.e. *RAM, Random Accessing Memory* (usually people saying, I have 8G memory in my computer, is actually refering to this) can only hold information when power on, once you turn off the computer, information lost. *HardDisk* (usually people saying Drive C, Drive D) can hold large amount of data and *RETAIN* information even power removed!
        
### Why all the BS?

Why wait your time to tell you all these junks? This is because it has hugh relationship with computer programming.
