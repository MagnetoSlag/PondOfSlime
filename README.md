## A little pond where I share some interesting info with CEO
To make life easier, there are few things I would like to clarifly before we step into the world of computer.
Some of them you may already know, some may be new to you and some maybe not the same as you knew before.
Anyway, please seat back and read with some spare time.
Ofcause, if you dont want to read, just move onto your js is ok.
### READ READ READ READ the god damn book!
Please execuse me for my poor English proficiency, as you always know, my English SUCKS....

*Read the god damn book!* is what I always heard from my college teacher. He once said, reading non-friction is boring, especially something technical or something you simply have no interest in.
